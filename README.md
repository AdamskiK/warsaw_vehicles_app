# Warsaw Vehicles app!


The application has been written in purpose of learning the Shiny package and deeper understanding of the R language. During the app creation I have struggled with many obstacles like problems with APIs provided by municipal services, a chaotic data structure of the bus and tram stops or app deployment on a server. Thanks you that project I have a better comprehension of:

- R language
- Shiny package
- regular expressions
- Unix language
- Nginx
- apps deployment

The app is available under the link: https://warsawvehicles.com/

The future directions are to add a tram schedule and enhance the application performance.
