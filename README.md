<h1 align="center">Warsaw Vehicles app!</h1>

<div align="center">

A simple app showing public transport vehicles in real time on the map.

I have written the application in purpose of learning the Shiny package and deeper understanding of the R language. During the development I have struggled with many obstacles like problems with APIs provided by municipal services, a chaotic data structure of the bus/tram stops and app deployment using DigitalOcean’s server. Thanks to that project I’ve gained a better comprehension of:

- R language
- Shiny package
- regular expressions
- Unix language
- Nginx
- apps deployment

The app is available under the link: https://warsawvehicles.com/ (currently unavailable, might be back soon)

Next steps regarding this application refer to enhancing performance issues and adding additional features like a tram schedule.
